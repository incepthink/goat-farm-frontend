   *   · B_p07_06 was previously excluded for a burned-in camera timestamp. It has been

   *     rest of the library, and the manifest records it.
   *   · B_p05_02 was a thumbnail in the old activity row. It is the only image in the
   *     entire library that holds both halves of the thesis in one frame — the women AND
   *     the plant — so it now opens the grid.
   *
   * The first entry is the lead and runs large beside the pull-quote.
   *
   * ⚠️  `ratio` is per-frame and it matters. image39 and image40 are 720×1281 — 9:16
   * vertical stills. They were previously rendered at `landscape` (3:2) with
   * object-center, which showed roughly 28% of the frame taken from the middle, cropping
   * out the hands, the udder and the bucket in both. They are the only photographs the
   * project owns of its own core transaction. They must stay at `portrait-tall`.
   *
   * Ratios are still only ever design-system tokens (CLAUDE.md §6 rule 2). The variety
   * comes from choosing a different token per slot, never from inventing one, so better
   * photography remains a file swap.
